- Change fixed point iterate (g) to conopt, cgd, etc 

    - Test on 8 mode guassian

- Use iterative QR (to solve constrained least square problem in AA)

- Later change it. Use better linear solver

## First

- Implement resnet + adam + wgan+GP, tune hyperparameter tuning. Use neel files

    - Basic code is just copy paste from CIFAR10.

    - Save weights, plots, inception score (store in csv file)

    - Run code for 4 days. My account has 4 nodes, so 4 hyperparameters in 4 days.

    - Deadline: 23rd August
